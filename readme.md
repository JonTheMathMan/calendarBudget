# calendarBudget

TODO:
- Make a calendar program that can create income or expense events that have category tags and account name tags.
- Have a setting that lets you choose what UI feature shows when the program starts (Default should maybe be create new event).
- Support repeating events: 
	- same day of the month or year
	- every integer days, weeks, months, years, so forth...
- Save calendar events data as a json file through browser saving.
- Read calendar events data from the saved json file.
